# WEB COMPONENTS DOCS

During this summer, we have been working on web components whit Base 22.
This was an amazing experience because the technologies that we used were new for us but not so complicated that we expected. Therefore, the learning curve wasnt deep.

In the next section, we will present the four components in what we were working during the stay in base 22

1. Directory
2. Side menu
3. Modal
4. Drawer
